Hello! I'm **Urs Grupp**, frontend engineer from the city of Freiburg in Southern Germany. Working as a web developer for more than 10 years, I've delivered award-winning high-quality results in dozens of web projects.

In 2017, I launched **21sieben**{.c-21sieben-inline}, a digital coding house where I'm handcrafting rock-solid, unique websites and web apps with an eye for detail. My passion lies in bringing beautiful designs to life, leveraging the **full power of frontend technology**.

When I'm not coding I like working the Black Forest, going sailing or snowboarding. Occasionally, you can find me in a concert hall with my orchestra, playing the violin.
