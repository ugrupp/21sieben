Hello! I'm **Urs Grupp**, frontend engineer from the city of Freiburg in Southern Germany. Working as a web developer for almost 10 years, I've delivered award-winning high-quality results in dozens of web projects.

In 2017, I founded **21sieben**{:.c-21sieben-inline}, a digital coding house where I'm handcrafting rock-solid, unique websites and web apps with an eye for detail. My passion lies in bringing beautiful designs to life, utilizing the **full power of frontend technology**.

As a graduated computer scientist, I also have a fundamental understanding of backend structures, which allowed me to expand my skill set to **JS app development** and **CMS integration**.

When I'm not coding I like making full use of the black forest, going sailing or snowboarding. Occasionally, you can find me in concert halls with my orchestra, playing the violin.
