Hello! I'm **Urs Grupp**, frontend engineer from the city of Freiburg in Southern Germany. Working as a web developer for almost 10 years, I've delivered award-winning high quality results in dozens of web projects.

In 2017, I founded **21sieben**{:.c-21sieben-inline}, a digital coding forgery where I'm hand-crafting rock-solid, unique websites with an eye for detail.
