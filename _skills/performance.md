# Performance

By applying a performance oriented implementation, caching and fine-tuning the server configuration, my web applications score high on performance analysis tools like [Google Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.21sieben.de) or [webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org).

In order to achieve that, I’m using technologies like Critical CSS, minification or service workers – besides just a reasonable way of programming in general.
