Iâ€™m building responsive, cross-browser compatible, maintainable, extendable and valid frontend components, based on CSS3+ and HTML5.

Following a modular approach by using conventions like BEM or Atomic Design and tools like Fractal or Pattern Lab, I'm proficient in rapidly creating design systems and component libraries at scale.
