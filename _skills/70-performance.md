My web applications feel snappy and score high on performance analysis tools like [Google Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.21sieben.de) or [webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org). This is accomplished by utilizing caching, minification, Critical CSS and fine-tuning the server configuration.
And, of course, just a performance- and detail-oriented way of coding.
