My frontend components are enriched by JavaScript functionality, following the progressive enhancement principle. By utilizing module bundlers, ES6 and Babel, my code becomes very robust and future-proof, while still being executable in legacy browsers.

I'm also experienced in building single-page applications with frameworks like Vue.js or React. In more complex projects, I reach for advanced state management mechanisms provided by Vuex or redux.
