My frontend components are enriched by JavaScript functionality, following the progressive enhancement principle. By utilizing module bundlers, ES6 and Babel, my code becomes very robust and future-proof, while still being executable in legacy browsers.

I'm also experienced in using frameworks like React or Vue.js â€“ either to build single-page applications or interactive modules integrated within classic websites.
