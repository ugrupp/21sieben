A neat little onepager for 21sieben web development:

## Random facts

* It's an Eleventy site (ported over from Jekyll)
* You'll need npm and node to run it on your machine
* It's deployed by netlify, using a lot of their cool features (CI, SSL, asset optimization, snippet injection). I'm happy with them, so here's their badge:
[![Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/global/badges/netlify-color-accent.svg)](https://www.netlify.com)
* Gulp workflow: Sass, JS (Browserify + Babel), svg icon system, Eleventy build, browsersync, linting etc.
* *It all started with a pen*, playing around with anime.js: https://codepen.io/21sieben/pen/YEMwwM
